# adopt-a-seed 🌱

## Overview

Adopt-a-Seed is a platform that promotes sustainable gardening by enabling users to adopt, grow, and return seeds. It integrates AI-generated insights, community engagement, and seed-tracking features to encourage biodiversity, food security, and climate-conscious planting.

## Getting Started

### Start Everything with a Single Command

To simplify setup, use the following command to start the frontend, backend, and additional services. This will also build the required Docker images.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Project Structure
